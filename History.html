              <b>Why we celebrate Republic day?</b> <br />When India gained
              independence, it did not have its own permanent Constitution. Any
              nation without a strong Constitution is at risk of collapsing. To
              address this, a committee was formed under the leadership of Dr.
              B.R. Ambedkar,

          which worked for almost three years to draft the Indian Constitution.
          On this day, 73 years ago, the Constitution of India came into force,
          officially making India a Republic. It is the longest written
          Constitution in the world, known for being both rigid yet flexible
          striking a perfect balance between federal and unitary features. Under
          British rule, Indians were denied even basic rights, and injustice was
          widespread. But on January 26, 1950, India finally gained the power to
          make its own laws. That is why Republic Day holds immense
          significance—it marks the day India became a sovereign, self-governing
          nation, free to uphold justice, equality, and democracy for all its
          citizens.
